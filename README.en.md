<a href="README.md">简体中文</a> PAPER-CRAFT MINIATURE · HORIZONTAL FLOATING STRIP · HANDMADE MATERIAL · AIRY COOL BLUE · GENEROUS SPACE

Rebuild the most recognisable source subject and limited supported environment as paper, cardstock, soft-clay, and thin-wood miniatures on one long floating landscape strip. Authentic craft detail, intimate macro light, and pale open space create a premium art-installation presence.

## Why this Skill exists

The style is source-dependent, not a decorative preset. Its operative transformation is:

```text
lock identity, silhouette, pose, direction, and relation → preserve three cues → select one primary subject and limited supported elements → rebuild paper, cardstock, soft-clay, and thin-wood miniatures → place them on one long horizontal floating strip → establish scale depth, overlap, and calm balance → reveal authentic craft through macro light → retain airy cool blue and generous space → add one signature-like short title
```

If an unrelated photograph could replace the source without materially changing recognition, model construction, support, strip silhouette, material, balance, colour, whitespace, and copy, the result does not belong to this Panel.

## The visual contract

- Preserve at least three source-specific cues across silhouette, proportion, pose, direction, action, structure, colour, material, or relation.
- Build one dominant primary miniature and limited source-supported models, all seated on one long, narrow, lightweight horizontal floating strip.
- Create depth through scale variation, layered overlap, and quieter foreground/background pieces; stay broadly centred without mechanical symmetry or a second focal point.
- Show paper fibres, folds, cut marks, layered thickness, rough rims, and tiny handmade imperfections; reject slick plastic CGI.
- Organise airy cool blues, ivory, pale beige, muted grey-green, and tiny muted-blush accents with soft macro light and generous pale negative space.

Aesthetic constraints and rejection rules live only in the [original source brief](references/052-source.md); the Skill and runtime adapter handle delivery variables only. [Skill workflow](SKILL.md) · [English runtime adapter](references/xxd-panel-052-prompt.en.md)

These samples demonstrate the 052 aesthetic motive. Their subjects, composition, palette, copy, and earlier canvas ratio never become generation references or current defaults.

## The original brief is authoritative

`references/052-source.md` is this project's sole creative and aesthetic authority. The Skill no longer summarizes or expands it, and it does not impose a shared palette, colour plan, aesthetic motive, title, or microcopy package. GPT Image 2 follows that brief's own rules for colour, material, composition, whitespace, wording, and typography.

Mode and size change only the legacy 3:4 top-bottom container. In left-right mode, the brief's upper photo and lower design map to the left and right. In design-only and wallpaper modes, the lower design language expands across the whole canvas. Every other source-brief instruction remains active.

## Four combinable output modes

Select one or more of `top-bottom`, `left-right`, `design-only`, and `wallpaper-pack`. Paired work is generated as one complete canvas by default; deterministic composition is only a fallback after a failed retry, for pixel-identical source preservation, or for lossless size calibration.

Ordinary sizes are also multi-select: auto-fit, source aspect, 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9, 5:7, 7:5, or custom ratios/exact pixels. There is no silent default. Every distinct aspect is independently recomposed from the same verbatim source brief.

Wallpaper packs may be linked or independent. A linked pack creates one anchor image, then recomposes each remaining device from the original source plus that anchor; it never crops one image into four sizes.

## Text modes

Before generation, resolve one of three choices:

1. **Model generates text from the original prompt**: the user supplies only the language or locale; GPT Image 2 follows the source brief's own wording, amount, tone, and typography logic.
2. **Use my exact text**: pass it verbatim, without rewriting, translating, or adding a title; typography still follows the source brief.
3. **No text**: prohibit visible text and pseudo-text.

The outer Skill no longer pre-writes titles, microcopy, or copy packages. Output language is resolved separately from the interface language and is never guessed from a person, scene, or filename.

## Complete-canvas first, raster-only delivery

The image model owns the aesthetics of the entire finished composition; paired layouts also default to one complete-canvas generation. `scripts/compose_panel.py` remains only for condition-based recovery, lossless pixel calibration, and read-only audit. It is not run pre-emptively and does not judge aesthetic success.

Every deliverable is a raster PNG and every invocation creates a fresh task under `~/Desktop/xxd/`. The configured image route exposes sanitised status only—never providers, endpoints, credentials, headers, prompts, responses, or account details. SVG, HTML, Canvas, diagrams, and programmatic drawing are not substitutes for the final artwork.

## Capability-adaptive questions and inline parameters

The same Skill adapts to the host's real interaction capabilities and never presents decorative symbols as clickable controls:

- **When Claude Code exposes `AskUserQuestion + multiSelect: true`**: modes and sizes use genuine checkboxes; text mode and wallpaper relationship use single-select. Common sizes are grouped into square, portrait, and landscape checkbox questions, selections accumulate across groups, and custom sizes use free input.
- **When Codex exposes only `request_user_input`**: use it only for mutually exclusive fields such as text mode and wallpaper relationship. Do not misrepresent modes or sizes as single-choice; collect them through clear combination input.
- **With no interactive question tool**: use two typed rounds—modes first, then sizes plus text. Never draw fake `- [ ]` boxes or ask the user to switch to Plan mode merely to obtain a form.

The second round initially shows only Smart recommendation, Source aspect, Common ratios, and Custom. Expand the full library only when requested: square `1:1`; portrait `3:4, 4:5, 2:3, 9:16, 5:7`; landscape `4:3, 5:4, 3:2, 16:9, 21:9, 7:5`. Any ratios may be combined, and exact pixels are always accepted.

All settings can also be passed inline:

```text
/xxd-panel-052 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom,design-only --size auto,3:4,9:16 --text prompt --locale ja-JP
```

Supported parameters are `--mode`, repeatable or comma-separated `--size`, `--text prompt|exact|none`, `--locale`, `--copy`, `--wallpaper linked|independent`, `--wallpaper-size`, and `--out`. Complete parameters skip preflight; partial parameters trigger only missing questions.

## Image-model priority

GPT Image 2 is the default first choice. It keeps this project's established workflow: high-fidelity source reference, explicit whole-canvas selection before generation, one complete-canvas generation for paired modes, and scripted composition only as a conditional fallback.

Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model may also be used when it is actually available through the current tools or configured routes and can satisfy source fidelity, whole-canvas ratio, target-language text, and linked-wallpaper multi-reference requirements. An alternative changes only the generation route; it must not change modes, canvas, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or the complete-canvas-first strategy.

If no suitable route is available, the Skill asks the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task without being echoed, displayed, logged, or exposed. They are not persisted, and provider, account, billing, or global route configuration is not modified, unless the user explicitly requests that configuration change.

## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-052.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/xxd-panel-052" ~/.codex/skills/xxd-panel-052
```

Claude Code users may link the same folder under `~/.claude/skills/xxd-panel-052`. Restart the agent session after installation.

```text
$xxd-panel-052
Use this photograph, ask me for the modes and copy setting, then generate fresh raster outputs.
```
